1. ABOUT THIS PROJECT
---------------------
Chaturanga is an open-source chess server that leverages a highly-decoupled MVC architecture to provide
support for a number of clients (telnet and web browser to start, with more to follow) as well as support
for XML-RPC in order to facilitate quick development of new client applications.

Chaturanga also provides email notifications, per-user RSS feeds and a framework for implementing custom
notification modules which make it easy to create bots.

5. INSTALLATION
---------------
While installation procedures for this software will always be slightly different depending upon the
peculiarities of your Tomcat and MySQL instances and the manner in which you prefer to administer them,
the following steps should work for default Tomcat and MySQL installs on Linux.

	1. Create the database that Chaturanga will use to persist data:
		
		mysqladmin -u root -p create chaturanga
		
	2. Set the proper encoding on the newly created database (using the MySQL command-line client):
	
		mysql> alter database `chaturanga` default character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci;
		
	3. Run the included SQL query batch (create_tables.sql) to create the table structure:
	
		mysql -u root -p default-character-set=utf8 chaturanga < create_tables.sql
		
	4. (Optional) Build the application from source if necessary (this is not necessary unless you are
		planning on modifying the application's source code):
		
		ant clean dist
		
	5. Modify server.xml as follows:
	
	6. Modify content.xml to set up your datasource:
		
	7. Deploy the Chaturanga WAR file (found in the dist directory) to your Tomcat webapps directory:
	
		cp chaturanga.war ${TOMCAT_HOME}/webapps 
	
	8. Start/restart your Tomcat instance and point your browser to http://hostname:port/chaturanga
		Provided that you see the welcome/login page staring back at you, you have a successful install.
