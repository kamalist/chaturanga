ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------
Chaturanga is an open-source chess server that leverages a highly-decoupled MVC architecture to provide
support for a number of clients (telnet and web browser to start, with more to follow) as well as support
for XML-RPC in order to facilitate quick development of new client applications.

Chaturanga also provides email notifications, per-user RSS feeds and a framework for implementing custom
notification modules which make it easy to create bots.

Please visit the project website at http://code.google.com/p/chaturanga/ for more information and access
to our Subversion repository.
